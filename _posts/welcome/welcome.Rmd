## Data  

This is data.  

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```


## Chart  

This is a chart.  

```{r echo=TRUE}
mtcars %>% 
  tibble::rownames_to_column("brand") %>% 
  mutate(cyl = factor(cyl),
         cyl = fct_reorder(cyl, mpg)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mpg, y = cyl)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

I'm am fucking starving. It looks like the cyl 4 has a median mpg of around 26 but the range is much wider than the other cylinder categories.
