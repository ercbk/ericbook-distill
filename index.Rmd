<!-- The postcard had a useless second scrollbar (in addition to the big one of distill). For some reason, I couldn't remove it with the CSS in custom.css. My only solution is to modify the source of the postcards::trestle template to remove this scrollbar. -->

## Bio

Currently, I'm contracting and consulting on data science projects.  

Previously, I served in the United States Air Force and earned degrees in Mathematics and Physics (Astrophysics & Computational Physics) at the University of Louisville. At U of L, I was a research assistant in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and focused on numerical solutions to Hartree-Fock equations for molecular orbitals.  

I enjoy working on open source projects and learning new methods and tools.  

Outside of data science, I enjoy science fiction, fantasy, and reading about politics and foreign policy. Also, I golf on occasion and watch most of the sportsball.
