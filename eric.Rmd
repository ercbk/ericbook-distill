## Bio

Currently, I'm contracting and consulting on data science projects.  

Previously, I served in the United States Air Force and earned degrees in Mathematics and Physics (Astrophysics / Computational Physics) at the University of Louisville. At U of L, I was a research assistant in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and focused on numerical solutions to Hartree-Fock equations for molecular orbitals.  

I enjoy working on open source projects and learning new methods and tools.  

Outside of data science, I enjoy science fiction, fantasy, and reading about politics and foreign policy. Also, I golf on occasion and watch most of the sportsball.
